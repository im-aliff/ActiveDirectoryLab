# Active Directory Setup and Management

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the setup and management of an Active Directory (AD) environment using a demo PC running Windows 10 and a Windows Server 2022 for Active Directory Domain Control. The project includes creating two organizations (IT and HR) and adding users Jenny Smith (jsmith) and Terry Smith (tsmith).

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Windows Server 2022 and Promote to Domain Controller

1. **Install Windows Server 2022**:
   - Boot from the installation media and follow the on-screen instructions to install Windows Server 2022.
   - Set up the network configuration and ensure the server has a static IP address.

2. **Promote to Domain Controller**:
   - Open Server Manager.
   - Add the `Active Directory Domain Services` (AD DS) role.
   - Follow the prompts to promote the server to a Domain Controller, creating a new forest and domain (e.g., `example.com`).

### Step 2: Set Up Windows 10 PC

1. **Install Windows 10**:
   - Boot from the installation media and follow the on-screen instructions to install Windows 10.

2. **Join Windows 10 to the Domain**:
   - Right-click on `This PC` and select `Properties`.
   - Click on `Change settings` next to the computer name.
   - Click `Change` and select `Domain`, then enter the domain name (e.g., `example.com`).
   - Provide domain administrator credentials to join the domain and restart the computer.

### Step 3: Create Organizational Units and Users

1. **Create Organizational Units**:
   - Open `Active Directory Users and Computers` on the Domain Controller.
   - Right-click on the domain name (e.g., `example.com`), select `New`, and then `Organizational Unit`.
   - Create OUs named `IT` and `HR`.

2. **Add Users**:
   - Right-click on the `IT` OU, select `New`, and then `User`.
   - Enter the user details for Jenny Smith (username: `jsmith`).
   - Repeat the process for the `HR` OU to create a user for Terry Smith (username: `tsmith`).

## Usage

### Managing Users

- **Reset Password**:
  - Open `Active Directory Users and Computers`.
  - Navigate to the user (e.g., `jsmith`), right-click, and select `Reset Password`.
  - Enter and confirm the new password.

- **Move User to Another OU**:
  - Open `Active Directory Users and Computers`.
  - Drag and drop the user (e.g., `jsmith`) to the desired OU.
